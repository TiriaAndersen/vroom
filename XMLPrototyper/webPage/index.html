			<p>VRPRep is community based repository designed to store vehicle
				routing problem benchmarks and solutions. The particularity of this
				repository is that all the data sets are built using the a unique
				file structure designed by the VRPRep team.
			</p>

			<h3><a name="whyUseVRPRep">Why use VRPRep ?</a></h3>
			<p>
				As previously mentioned, the repository is based on community
				development. The idea is that anybody who has a set of VRP
				benchmarks should translate them to the VRPRep file structure and
				upload them onto the website.<br /> The structure was developped with
				the idea that having a unique data format would simplify the use of
				the benchmarks as only one script would need to be developped to
				read all the data for a problem, whoever the author.<br /> A set of
				tools are currently being designed to help the users integrate their
				data on the website. These tools include :
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A XML File Prototype Generator : Helps the user understand
					the VRP Rep file structure</li>
				<li>A solution checker : Allows the user to check his solution
					is valid</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end, the repository should hold a vast set of
				benchmarks and solutions built using the same data structure.</p>
