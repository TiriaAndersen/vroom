		<h3>Universal VRP Representational Structure</h3>
		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>
			The unique file structure is capable of representing multiple vehicle routing problems and it is used to represent
			all the data sets on this website. The structure was developed using Extensible Markup Language (XML). 
			This language has the benefit of defining a file structure that is both human and machine-readable.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Description of the structure</h4>
		<p>
			The final structure is divided into 4 sections :
			<dl style="margin-left: 20px;">
				<dt>Info :</dt>
				<dd>Holds the information about the problem structure, the original author or the instance and finally
				 the contributor (i.e. the person who created the wrote the instance using this format).<br /><br /></dd>
				<dt>Network :</dt>
				<dd>Holds the information relative to the "graph" of the problem. This section will describe the node
				parameters (e.g. location), link parameters (e.g. weights) and any further information about the graph
				(e.g. if it is complete).<br /><br /></dd>
				<dt>Fleet :</dt>
				<dd>Holds information about the vehicles. This is where all the vehicle parameters and constraints 
				must be defined. Some of the parameters and constraints include: vehicle costs, site/node compatibilites,
				 speed characteristics, workload profiles and vehicle and compartment capacities.<br /><br /></dd>
				<dt>Requests :</dt>
				<dd>Finally, this section defines events at nodes or on links. These events can include demands, service times,
				time window constraints, release dates for dynamic routing problems, task/request dependencies, etc.<br /><br /></dd>
			</dl>
		</p>
		
		<h4>The structures flexibility</h4>
		<p>
			Firstly, as the structure is fairly complete, it is evident that not all of the defined elements would be necessary to
			represent a particular routing problem. For this reason, only the essential elements that are required to
			define a routing problem are defined as compulsary within the structure.<br />
			Secondly, the structure is already capable of representing many vehicle routing problems such as VRPTW, MDVRPSD and VRPPDTW.
			But there are often atypical constraints within problems such as employee work time constraints, vehicle accessibilty issues,
			 etc. This causes no problem with the VRPRep structure as it is completely extensible. The structure serves as a guideline
			to representing a vehicle routing problem, and if necessary, users can add nonexistant elements to the structure
			to adapt it to their problem. 
		</p>

		<h3><a name="XMLFilePrototypeGenerator">XML File Prototype Generator</a></h3>
		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>
			As described in the above, the VRPRep file structure is fairly complete. Evidently this means the file holding the 
			structure which is written using XML Schema language is fairly intimidating, particularly for someone with no  
			XML knoxledge.
			For this reason a file prototype generator was created. The generator offers a series of questions allowing the user 
			to describe his problem, it even offers the possibility to define elements that he wishes to create. In return, the  
			program generates a XML file based on the VRPRep structure but adapted to the users problem.
		</p>
		
		<h4>Description of the generator</h4>
		<p>
			The generator is a JAVA executable program that offers the questions in a user friendly graphical interface.<br />
			The questions are split into the four same categories as the VRPRep file structure (info, network, fleet
			 and requests). Therefor, the first step for the user will be to fill the information descibing his problem, the author
			 and the contributor of the instance. Secondly he will build up the network structure by describing the nodes or/and the links. 
			 Thirdly he will define the structure of the fleet including vehicle characteristics and constraints. And finally he will
			 define the events in the problem.<br />
			Finally, before allowing the user to move to the next stage of the questionnaire or generating the prototype, 
			 it performs a series of checks making sure all the necessary questions are filled in. It also shows or hides questions
			 depending on the answers of the user eliminating the risk that a user would generate a non valid file.
