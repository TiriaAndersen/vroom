		<h3>What is VRPRep ?</h3>
		<p>
			VRPRep is community based repository designed to store vehicle routing problem benchmarks and solutions. The 
			particularity of this repository is that all the data sets are built using the a unique file structure
			designed by the VRPRep team. 
		</p>
		<h3>Why use VRPRep ?</h3>
		<p>
			As previously mentioned, the repository is based on community development. The idea is that anybody who has a set
			of VRP benchmarks should translate them to the VRPRep file structure and upload them onto the website.<br />
			The structure was developped in the idea that having a unique data format would simplify the use of the benchmarks 
			as only one script would need to be developped to read all the data for a problem, whoever the author.<br />
			A set of tools are currently being designed to help the users integrate their data on the website. These tools
			include :
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A XML File Prototype Generator : Helps the user understand the VRP Rep file structure</li>
			<li>A solution checker : Allows the user to check his solution is valid</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			By the end, the repository should hold a vast set of benchmarks and solutions built using the same data structure.
