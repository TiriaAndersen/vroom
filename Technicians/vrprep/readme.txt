The following 56 instances of the TRSP are based on the Solomon (1987) benchmark. 
For each instance, we considered a crew of 25 technicians with different home locations, skills, initial set of tools and spare parts. 
In addition, we generated requests by adding skill, tool, and spare part information to each customer.
