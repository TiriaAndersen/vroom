Contains generic objects to define a vehicle routing problem (VRP).

<p>An instance of a problem is defined by an {@link
vroom.modelling.jvrp.dataModel.StaticInstance} or {@link
vroom.modelling.jvrp.dataModel.DynamicInstance} depending on the
nature of the problem. Each instance has a {@link
vroom.modelling.jvrp.dataModel.VehicleRoutingProblemDefinition} associated to it, providing a description
of the related VRP.</p>

<p>More specifically, an <b>instance</b> contains a {@link
vroom.modelling.jvrp.dataModel.Fleet} composed by a set of {@link
vroom.modelling.jvrp.dataModel.Vehicle}s with given {@link vroom.modelling.jvrp.dataModel.attributes.IVehicleAttribute}s, 
as well as a set of {@link vroom.modelling.jvrp.dataModel.Request}s associated
with {@link vroom.modelling.jvrp.dataModel.Node}(s) and with specific
{@link vroom.modelling.jvrp.dataModel.attributes.IRequestAttribute}s.
This package also allow the representation of a {@link
vroom.modelling.jvrp.dataModel.Solution} by defining a set of {@link
vroom.modelling.jvrp.dataModel.IRoute}s composed by a sequence of
{@link vroom.modelling.jvrp.dataModel.NodeVisit}s</p>
